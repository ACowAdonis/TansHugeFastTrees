This is the backup of this mod. To open this, use IntelliJ (Recommended), or use MCreator. I do both sides, one for complex systems, other one for general and hard things such as GUI and overlay.

# How To Use

For IntelliJ
- To run client or server. Go to "Gradle" tab at right side, select `Tasks / forgegradle runs / runClient or runServer`.
- To export the mod to JAR format. Go to "Gradle" tab at right side, select `Tasks / build / build`. The exported file will be in project folder `build > libs`.

For MCreator
- Open this by using MCreator the same version as the branch name, with plugins I put in the folder. Then select open project, when on file selection screen, select "XXX.mcreator".

# Agreements

- You can read and study from my codes. But do not copy, edit, and suggest about the edit.

# From Creator

My mods are personal projects, they're not open for editing and contributions, and I will ignore all suggestions related to my systems. You're welcome to read and study their codes, but please do not copy, edit or submit any suggestion to edit parts of it. I made mods for my feeling first, just like doing an artwork. What I want to do, my ideas, and for my imaginary world. Using methods I like. Hope you understand and respect that. (╯ ‿╰ ' )

What about Fabric port of my mods? Unfortunately, I'm not fan of Fabric. I don't want to spend my lifetime to do that, when I don't even have fun to do it. Fabric port will be a lot hard work for me, like living in hell. There maybe someone in the future, who interested in helping port it. But that I have to consider that first, and they must agree with my decision at above.
