This is the backup of this mod. Open in MCreator the same version as the branch name, with plugins I put in the folder (if have). Or open in programs that can read/edit code, such as IntelliJ. I would recommened to open on both sides, as some of my mods will contain both MCreator parts and handcode.

My mods are personal projects, I made them for my feeling first, just like doing an artwork. What I want to do, my ideas, and for my imaginary world. Using methods I like. They're not open for editing and contributions, and I will ignore all suggestions related to my systems. You're welcome to read and study their code, but please do not edit or submit any suggestion to edit parts of it. I'm not okay to let people to draw anything on my canvas. Hope you understand and respect that. (╯ ‿╰ ' )

What about Fabric port of my mods? Unfortunately, I'm not fan of Fabric. I don't want to spend my life time to do that, when I don't even have fun to do it. Also I don't want to be a programmer -_-) Fabric port will be a lot hard work for me, like living in hell. There maybe someone in the future, who interested in helping port it. But that I have to consider that first, and they must agree with my decision at above.
