This is the backup of this mod. To open this, use IntelliJ (Recommended), or use MCreator. I do both sides, one for complex systems, other one for general and hard things such as GUI and overlay.

# How To Use

For IntelliJ
- To run client or server. Go to "Gradle" tab at right side, select `Tasks / forgegradle runs / runClient or runServer`.
- To export the mod to JAR format. Go to "Gradle" tab at right side, select `Tasks / build / build`. The exported file will be in project folder `build > libs`.

For MCreator
- Open this by using MCreator the same version as the branch name, with plugins I put in the folder. Then select open project, when on file selection screen, select "XXX.mcreator".

# Terms of Use

# From Creator

Thank you all for playing my mods! I'm happy to see people enjoy my hobby. I maybe not a great modder, who always open for requests and suggestions. I made mods for my feeling first, just like doing an artwork. What I want to do, my ideas, and for my imaginary world. Using methods I like. Hope you understand and respect that. (╯ ‿╰ ' ) If you want to support me, you can become my Patreon membership, and buying my artworks. Anyway, you can easily support me by playing my mods, and follow my artworks on Twitter (X).

Will I do Fabric port of my mods? Unfortunately, I'm not fan of Fabric. I don't want to spend my lifetime to do that, when I don't even have fun to do it. Also please understand that I have 3 mods, which all is very complex and detailed. Fabric port will be a lot hard work for me, like living in hell. There maybe someone in the future, who interested in helping port it. But that I have to consider that first, and they must agree with my decision at above.
